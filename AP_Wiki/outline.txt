Url's:
'/home' or '/':
- Main information about Kurricula
- Logo at the top
- Nav bar at the top

'/about':
- Describes Kurricula in further detail
- Says who made it and some stuff about them (me :))
- Provide some contact like an email, ideally something like enrolld@gmail.com
- Provide LinkedIn page
- Also, link your personal blog page (work in progress)

'/courses':
- A list of courses
- Ideally has a filter system so that people can find regular, AP, honors, etc.
- Also, it could filter by subject
- Each course would display their ratings, name, difficulty, and a short description (that would be cutoff unless the user clicks on the course)

'/courses/X'
- The X would be the name of the course
- Find some way to make an adaptable page based on the course (Create a template course HTML file that each course can use)
- The ratings by all the users, overall ratings, short description, title of course, etc. would all be displayed

Overall
- Learn how to work with bootstrap better, so you can actually use it instead of copying code from tutorials
- Create a database for the users
- Make a user authentication system, allow users to both register and login
